Detoxification with Self-Constrained Decoding (DSCD) This repository introduces Detoxification with Self-Constrained Decoding (DSCD), a novel method to safely detoxify large language models (LLMs) without requiring parameter fine-tuning. DSCD enhances the safety of LLM outputs by adjusting next-token distributions during generation. 
Please stay tuned for the upcoming code release!
