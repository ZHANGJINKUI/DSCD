# DSCD
DSCD (Detoxification with Self-Constrained Decoding) is a method for safely detoxifying large language models (LLMs) without fine-tuning. It adjusts next-token distributions during generation to enhance safety, reduce hallucination and toxicity, and integrates easily with existing detoxification frameworks.
